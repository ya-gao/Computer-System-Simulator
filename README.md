# Computer-System-Simulator
In this project we will design, implement and test a simulator to simulate a basic machine.  The project principally focusing on the ISA and how it is executed, memory structure, and simple I/O capabilities. A deeper understanding of the design, structure, and operations of a computer system is addressed. What's more, we get to experience some of the tradeoff decisions that computer designers make.

The computer system that a simulator developed for is a classic instruction set architecture modeled after, but not equivalent to any known CISC machines. Our computer is a 16-bit processor that will eventually accommodate both fixed-point and floating-point arithmetic operations. 

The instruction set architecture (ISA) consists of 64 possible instructions. There are several instruction formats, however, not all instructions are defined. If you try to execute an opcode for an undefined instruction, there will be a machine fault.
