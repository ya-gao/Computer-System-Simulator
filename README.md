# Computer-System-Simulator
This project is structured into four segments building towards a fairly complex simulation of a computer system. A deeper understanding of the design, structure, and operations of a computer system is addressed. The project principally focusing on the ISA and how it is executed, memory structure, and simple I/O capabilities.
